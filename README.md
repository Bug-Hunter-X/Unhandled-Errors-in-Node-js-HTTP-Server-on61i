# Unhandled Errors in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: the lack of proper error handling in an HTTP server. The initial `server.js` file shows a basic HTTP server that lacks error handling.  The improved version, `server-solution.js`, demonstrates how to implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes and improve application stability.

## How to run the examples

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node server.js` to run the original, error-prone code.
4. Run `node server-solution.js` to see how to handle errors gracefully.
